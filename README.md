<details><summary>Install the Config</summary>

- Make a backup of your current Neovim files:

  ```sh
  mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
  mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
  ```

- Clone the starter

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/sajayprakash/neovim ~/.config/nvim
  ```

- Remove the `.git` folder, so you can add it to your own repo later

  ```sh
  rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
  ```

- Start Neovim!

  ```sh
  nvim
  ```
